 * <p>
 * The offsets, lengths and fields that this parser understands and exposes are based on version
 * 6.3.3 of the ZIP specification (the most recent available at the time of this writing), which may

 * there is no guarantee that all ZIP implementations have set the value correctly to the minimum
 * needed to truly support extraction.
